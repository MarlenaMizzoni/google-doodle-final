# Lofi City Scape Google Doodle

I have always loved the chill vibe of the screensavers when I am playing Lofi beats. I thought it would cool to take my beta city scape, and make a day and night version that have that same vibe. I wanted the animations to be subtle, and something that happens slowly overtime instead of all at once.
